Haze Tools is an open-source recreation of the Steam Tools .dll, written in Python, which, together with the "Green Luma 2025" dependency, allows you to test the game  before deciding to buy it. 
Absolutely NEVER play from beginning to end, only test the performance and buy the game legally if you like it and it runs well on your machine. 
This tool has clear advantages compared to the refund system because: The refund system can be disabled or limited if you request a refund for many games and when you request a refund, in many cases you cannot get your money back to your bank, in my country only 4 payments methods are accepted for refunds on the Bank, the other 10 payment methods will get your money stuck inside Steam Wallet without the option to move to your Bank account; Steam holds the money. 
With this tool, you can test games without the negative aspects of the original Steam refund system. If Steam ever fix these two negative points, I will promptly delete this repo.

This tool was absolutely never intended to assist with piracy; buy the games you like and that run well on your system. Support the developers; each game costs millions of dollars to create. You can't play them from beginning to end, so buy the games! Again, I emphasize that this tool is only for TESTING games without having to deal with the negative aspects of the refund system mentioned earlier.

Being able to test games without limitations before buying them is every consumer's right. For example, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/mAGNdK2.jpeg">in this game</a>, I only got 16 FPS. And with my payment method, Steam doesn't allow refunds to my bank account, so my money would be stuck in my Steam wallet forever, which I find unacceptable. With my tool I was able to test and see that my system can't handle the game. My Money is on my bank account and not stuck on my steam wallet.  

# Some notes:  
It's compatible with [SteamPortable](https://github.com/Ghostwillower/SteamPortable), so you can have one Steam just for testing the games, which make stuff more organized.  
You need to keep GreenLuma updated to keep up with the Steam updates, otherwise the downloads won't work. For coincidence some days ago a Steam update broke Luma and only today (22 nov) it was fixed. So if it stop working, just wait for a Luma update.  
I believe the tool is self explanatory with a UI easy to understand. But you can request a "how to use" tutorial in the "issues" section.  

# What Haze Tools Will Do

Haze Tools will just edit and create some text files on Steam directory.

# What Haze Tools Wont Do

Haze Tools WILL NEVER do any of the following:

Haze Tools will never make any game appear on your Steam app. For that, you need external tools like "Green Luma 2025", avaliable <a href="https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=103709">here</a>  
Haze Tools will never assist with bypassing or removing any kind of DRM, external launchers, anti-cheats or other protections that the game might have.  
Haze Tools will never promote, encourage, or assist with piracy.
